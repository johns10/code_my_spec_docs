# Campaign 3: Live Problem Solving (Continuous Engagement)

## Objective

Build authentic relationships and organic awareness within the Elixir community through consistent, helpful participation in discussions. Establish personal credibility as a knowledgeable community member before anyone sees you as a product seller.

## Philosophy

This is NOT stealth marketing. This is genuine community participation where you:
- Help people solve real problems
- Share knowledge generously
- Build relationships over time
- Occasionally mention your work when genuinely relevant

**Key principle:** Give 10x more value than you extract. Help 10 people before mentioning your product once.

## Timeline

**Continuous, starting immediately**
Daily commitment: 30-60 minutes
Long-term play: 6+ months to see full results

## Response Templates

### Template 1: AI Tool Frustration

**Situation:** Someone complaining about Copilot/ChatGPT generating wrong Elixir code

**Response structure:**
```
1. Empathy: "I've experienced this too..."
2. Explanation: "The reason this happens is..."
3. Data: "Research shows..." [link to your problem_statement if relevant]
4. Solution: "What's helped me is..."
5. Offer: "Happy to discuss further if helpful"
```

**Example:**
> I've run into the exact same issue - Copilot keeps suggesting Ruby patterns when I'm writing Elixir.
>
> The core problem is that AI models are trained predominantly on imperative languages (Python, JavaScript, Java), so they struggle with functional programming patterns and Elixir-specific idioms like pattern matching and OTP principles.
>
> [I researched this extensively](link to problem_statement) and found that GitClear's data shows AI-generated code will hit nearly 7% churn by 2025, with functional languages being hit particularly hard because of training data bias.
>
> What's helped me is:
> 1. Using explicit comments describing the desired Elixir pattern before letting AI generate
> 2. Breaking down generation into smaller, well-defined functions
> 3. Having architectural constraints in place that AI must work within
>
> For your specific example with GenServers, here's the pattern you want:
> [code example]
>
> Happy to elaborate if helpful!

**When to mention CodeMySpec:** Only if they ask "How do you enforce architectural constraints?" or similar follow-up.

---

### Template 2: Phoenix Architecture Questions

**Situation:** "Where should I put this logic?" / "How do I structure contexts?"

**Response structure:**
```
1. Clarifying question: Understand their specific case
2. Phoenix convention: Explain the "official" way
3. Trade-offs: Discuss when to deviate
4. Example: Show concrete code
5. Resources: Link to Phoenix docs or good blog posts
```

**Example:**
> Great question - this is one of the trickiest parts of Phoenix architecture. Can you share a bit more about what this logic does and how it relates to your domain?
>
> Generally, Phoenix contexts should represent distinct sub-domains of your application. Each context should:
> - Encapsulate a specific area of business logic
> - Expose a clear, high-level public API
> - Hide internal implementation details (schemas, repos, etc.)
>
> For your example with user authentication, I'd structure it like:
> [code example showing context boundary]
>
> The key is keeping contexts loosely coupled. If Context A needs data from Context B, it should call B's public API, never access B's schemas directly.
>
> Chris McCord's talk on contexts is excellent: [link]
> Phoenix docs on contexts: [link]
>
> Let me know if you want me to sketch out a specific example for your use case!

**When to mention CodeMySpec:** If they're managing a complex application with many contexts and ask about tooling: "I built a tool that tracks component dependencies to help with this - DM if you want to see it."

---

### Template 3: Testing Strategy

**Situation:** Questions about test structure, TDD, what to test

**Response structure:**
```
1. Philosophy: Your approach to testing
2. Levels: Unit, integration, E2E
3. Phoenix-specific: Context tests, controller tests, LiveView tests
4. Example: Show a well-tested module
5. Tools: Mention helpful libraries
```

**Example:**
> I'm a big believer in test-first development, especially for Phoenix applications where business logic is well-separated into contexts.
>
> Here's how I approach testing a Phoenix app:
>
> **1. Context tests (unit-ish):**
> Test your business logic through the context's public API. These should be fast and comprehensive.
> [code example]
>
> **2. Integration tests:**
> Test interactions between contexts and with the database. Use `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox` for isolation.
> [code example]
>
> **3. Controller/LiveView tests:**
> Test the web layer's integration with contexts. Focus on happy paths and error handling.
> [code example]
>
> **Key principle:** Test behavior, not implementation. If you can refactor without changing tests, you're doing it right.
>
> Libraries I use:
> - ExUnit (built-in, excellent)
> - ExMachina for test data
> - Wallaby for E2E (if needed)
> - Mox for mocking external services
>
> What specific testing scenario are you trying to figure out?

**When to mention CodeMySpec:** If they ask about test generation or automated testing: "I've been working on test generation workflows - basically generating tests from component designs before implementing. Works really well with TDD. Happy to share more if interested."

---

### Template 4: OTP Pattern Confusion

**Situation:** GenServer deadlocks, Supervisor questions, process design

**Response structure:**
```
1. Diagnose: Identify the specific issue
2. Explain: OTP principle involved
3. Fix: Correct implementation
4. Pattern: General principle they can apply
5. Resources: Point to good OTP learning materials
```

**Example:**
> Ah, you've hit a classic GenServer deadlock! The problem is in this line:
> [point out the issue]
>
> When a GenServer calls itself synchronously with `GenServer.call(self(), ...)`, it deadlocks because it's waiting for itself to respond, but it can't respond until the current call completes.
>
> Here's the fix:
> [corrected code using direct function call or cast]
>
> **General principle:**
> - Use `call` for synchronous requests to OTHER processes
> - Use `cast` for async messages to other processes
> - Use direct function calls for logic within the same process
> - Never `call` yourself
>
> For your supervision tree question, it depends on your restart strategy:
> [explain :one_for_one vs :one_for_all etc.]
>
> Great OTP resources:
> - Sasa Juric's "Elixir in Action" (Chapter on concurrency)
> - "Learn You Some Erlang" OTP sections
> - Ben Marx's talks on OTP patterns
>
> Want me to review your full supervision tree design?

**When to mention CodeMySpec:** If discussing agent architectures or multi-agent systems: "I use OTP supervision for managing AI agent sessions - works beautifully for fault tolerance. Each design session is a GenServer that can crash and restart without losing work. Happy to share the pattern if you're interested."

## Product Mention Decision Tree

```
Is the question directly about AI-assisted development workflows?
ââ YES â Highly relevant, ok to mention naturally
â   ââ Did they ask for tool recommendations?
â   â   ââ YES â "I built CodeMySpec for this - DM if you want to see it"
â   ââ NO â Help first, then: "I've been working on tooling for this problem if you're interested"
â
ââ NO â Is it about Phoenix architecture/testing/dependencies?
    ââ YES â Answer fully, then optionally:
    â   ââ "I track this in my workflow tool - happy to share approach"
    â
    ââ NO â Help without mentioning CodeMySpec
```

**General rule:** Mention your product max 1 in 10 responses. Help 10 people purely for the sake of helping first.

## Red Flags to Avoid

**Bad actor indicators (disengage if you see these in yourself):**
- â Copying same response to multiple threads
- â Mentioning product in every response
- â Responding instantly to everything (looks automated)
- â Only engaging with "opportunity" posts
- â Disappearing after product mention
- â Defensive reactions to criticism of your approach
- â Not actually reading the full question before responding

**Good community member indicators:**
- â Tailored responses to each question
- â Rarely mentioning your product
- â Engaging with variety of topics
- â Following up on conversations
- â Participating in non-opportunity discussions
- â Accepting feedback gracefully
- â Clearly reading and understanding before responding

## Long-term Vision

**6 months from now:**
- Recognized as helpful community member
- Natural conversations about your work
- Beta users from community relationships
- Organic advocacy from people you've helped
