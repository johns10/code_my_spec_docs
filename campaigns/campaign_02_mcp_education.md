# Campaign 2: MCP for Elixir Development (Educational Track)

## Objective

Establish thought leadership on Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with Elixir/Phoenix development while educating the community on cutting-edge AI agent architecture. Position CodeMySpec as the premier implementation of MCP for Elixir workflows.

## Why This Works

- **Cutting-edge topic:** MCP is new (Anthropic launched late 2024), few Elixir examples exist
- **Natural fit:** Your MCP servers are genuinely innovative
- **Educational demand:** Developers want to understand agent architectures
- **Low competition:** Not many Elixir-specific MCP resources yet
- **SEO opportunity:** Early content ranks well for emerging topics

## Timeline

Ongoing weekly content after Campaign 1 launch

## Channel Strategy

**Primary:**
- r/elixir (technical implementation)
- dev.to #elixir #ai (long-form tutorials)
- Your own blog/docs site (SEO, ownership)

**Secondary:**
- r/programming (when content is exceptional)
- r/MachineLearning (agent architecture discussions)
- Hacker News (for major pieces only)

**Tertiary:**
- Twitter threads (summaries with link to full content)
- Elixir Forum (deep technical Q&A)
- YouTube (screencasts if comfortable)

## Promotion Strategy

**For each post:**

1. **Primary publication:**
   - Reddit r/elixir (most engagement)
   - dev.to with #elixir #ai #mcp tags
   - Your own blog (SEO, ownership)

2. **Social amplification:**
   - Twitter thread summarizing key points
   - Tag relevant people (Anthropic team, José Valim if appropriate)
   - Share in Elixir Discord #resources

3. **Community submission:**
   - ElixirWeekly (René Föhring)
   - Elixir Forum link (in appropriate category)
   - Hacker News (only for Posts 6, 11, 12)

4. **Engagement tactics:**
   - Respond to all comments within 24 hours
   - Create GitHub repo per post with code
   - Offer to help anyone implementing similar patterns
   - Cross-link related posts in series

## SEO Strategy

**Target keywords:**
- "Elixir MCP server"
- "Phoenix Model Context Protocol"
- "AI agents Elixir"
- "Multi-agent systems Phoenix"
- "Elixir AI development"
- "MCP tutorial Phoenix"

**On-page optimization:**
- Descriptive URLs (blog.codemyspec.com/mcp-phoenix-tutorial)
- Meta descriptions with keywords
- Header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Internal linking between posts
- External links to Anthropic docs, Phoenix guides

**Link building:**
- Guest posts on DockYard, SmartLogic blogs
- Podcast appearances (Thinking Elixir)
- Conference talk slides with links
- GitHub repos with README links back
- dev.to canonical URLs to your blog

## Metrics and Success Criteria

**Per post:**
- 50+ upvotes on Reddit
- 20+ comments with technical engagement
- 500+ dev.to views
- 5+ GitHub stars on related repo
- 1-2 Twitter shares by community leaders

**Series-wide (6 months):**
- 5,000+ total blog visits
- 200+ GitHub stars across repos
- ElixirWeekly feature 3+ times
- Conference talk invitation
- 10+ agencies request demos
- 3+ companies mention using your MCP patterns

## Content Reuse Strategy

**Repurpose each post as:**
- Twitter thread (5-7 tweets)
- LinkedIn article (for agency decision-makers)
- YouTube video/screencast (if comfortable)
- Conference talk proposal (combine 3-4 posts)
- Podcast talking points (Thinking Elixir pitch)

**Aggregate content into:**
- "Complete Guide to MCP in Elixir" ebook (all 12 posts)
- Workshop curriculum (hands-on version)
- Documentation site section
- Conference tutorial (half-day workshop)

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential issues:**

1. **MCP changes (breaking API changes)**
   - Solution: Version-specific content, update guides
   - Monitor Anthropic announcements closely

2. **Limited initial interest (too niche)**
   - Solution: Cross-post to r/MachineLearning, r/programming
   - Frame as general agent architecture, not just Elixir

3. **Technical depth overwhelming**
   - Solution: Provide "beginner" and "advanced" sections
   - Include working code repos for all skill levels

4. **Competition emerges**
   - Solution: Emphasize your production experience
   - Collaborate rather than compete on educational content

5. **Burnout from weekly content**
   - Solution: Build content buffer (write 3-4 posts ahead)
   - Consider guest posts from beta users
   - Bi-weekly schedule acceptable if needed

## Next Steps

- [ ] Set up dev.to account with CodeMySpec branding
- [ ] Create content blog section on codemyspec.com
- [ ] Draft Post 1 (intro to MCP)
- [ ] Prepare code examples and repos
- [ ] Design architecture diagrams
- [ ] Schedule Post 1 for week after Campaign 1 launch
- [ ] Set up analytics tracking (Google Analytics, dev.to insights)
- [ ] Create Twitter thread templates
- [ ] Reach out to ElixirWeekly for submission guidelines
