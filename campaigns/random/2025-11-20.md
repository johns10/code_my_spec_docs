# Should I name my product CodeMyShit or CodeMySpec? Claude said the former is enterprise sales suicide, but I want a real person to weigh in.

I'm basically building a product that keeps LLMs from shitting up your codebase.

My original working title was CodeMyShit and I loved it.

Claude (and normal good sense) made me realize it probably won't fly.

I realized though, in the age of AI, everything is aimed right at the middle. It's the same formulaic shit over and over again (as if humans weren't already bad enough).

So I wonder, is it a time to let it all hang out and let em know there's some real people running around, or just keep aiming for the middle and do what everyone else does?
