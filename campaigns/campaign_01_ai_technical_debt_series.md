# Campaign 1: AI Technical Debt Series (4-Week Launch)

## Objective

Launch CodeMySpec to the r/elixir community with credibility and buy-in through a research-backed educational series that positions the product as a natural solution to documented problems.

## Timeline

4 weeks, one major post per week (Tuesday or Wednesday for best engagement)

## Strategy

Build from problem → patterns → solution → product launch. Each post stands alone as valuable content while building toward the launch. Never lead with selling; always lead with education.

## Week 1: The Problem Post

### Title Options
1. "GitClear's data shows AI-generated code will hit 7% churn by 2025 - Why Elixir developers might be hit hardest"
2. "The hidden cost of AI-assisted development: 7% code churn and rising technical debt"
3. "I analyzed 6 months of research on AI code quality - here's why functional programmers should be worried"

**Recommended:** Option 1 (most specific, data-driven, targets audience)

### Content Structure

**Hook (First 2 paragraphs):**
- Lead with GitClear's shocking statistic
- Mention Google's 7.2% decrease in delivery stability despite 25% increase in AI usage
- Frame as industry-wide problem, not Elixir-specific yet

**The Problem (Body):**
- AI tools lack deep codebase understanding
- Violation of DRY principles
- Context window limitations
- Code that "works" but fails production standards

**Why Elixir Developers Are Hit Hardest:**
- AI trained predominantly on imperative languages (Python, JavaScript, Java)
- Functional programming patterns poorly understood
- OTP principles invisible to AI models
- Phoenix context boundaries routinely violated

**The Data:**
- Quote specific developers from personas research
- Include examples: "copilot doesn't understand when I'm coding in Elixir or Ruby"
- Show the productivity trap: fast code generation → slow debugging

**Transition (NOT selling yet):**
- "I've been researching solutions to this problem for the past 6 months..."
- "The answer isn't to avoid AI, but to structure how we use it"
- Invite discussion: "What's been your experience with AI tools in Elixir?"

**Call to Action:**
- Ask for comments sharing experiences
- No product mention in main post
- If asked in comments: "I'm working on some tooling around this - happy to share more next week"

### Source Material
- `/docs/problem_statement.md` sections 1-3
- `/docs/personas/elixir_developers.md` AI tool failures section
- GitClear research (already cited in problem_statement)
- Google DORA report data

### Success Metrics
- Upvote ratio >75%
- Comments >20 with substantive technical discussion
- Community leaders (if any) engage
- DMs asking about the research or solutions

## Week 2: Pattern Failure Deep-Dive

### Title Options
1. "I cataloged 50+ instances where ChatGPT/Copilot violate Phoenix context boundaries - here's what I found"
2. "How AI tools systematically break Elixir/Phoenix architectural patterns: A technical analysis"
3. "The specific ways AI-generated Elixir code fails: OTP, Phoenix, and LiveView anti-patterns"

**Recommended:** Option 3 (most comprehensive, invites saving/bookmarking)

### Content Structure

**Introduction:**
- Reference Week 1 discussion
- Thank community for sharing experiences
- Introduce: "I spent the last several months documenting specific failure patterns"

**Category 1: OTP Misunderstandings**
```elixir
# AI-generated code (WRONG)
def handle_call(:get_state, _from, state) do
  result = GenServer.call(self(), :transform_state)  # Deadlock!
  {:reply, result, state}
end

# What it should be
def handle_call(:get_state, _from, state) do
  result = transform_state(state)  # Direct function call
  {:reply, result, state}
end
```
- Explain why this happens (training data patterns)
- Show consequences (production deadlocks)

**Category 2: Phoenix Context Boundary Violations**
```elixir
# AI-generated code (WRONG)
defmodule MyAppWeb.UserController do
  def create(conn, params) do
    # Directly accessing Repo from controller
    user = Repo.insert!(%User{email: params["email"]})
    render(conn, "show.html", user: user)
  end
end

# What it should be
defmodule MyAppWeb.UserController do
  alias MyApp.Accounts

  def create(conn, params) do
    case Accounts.create_user(params) do
      {:ok, user} -> render(conn, "show.html", user: user)
      {:error, changeset} -> render(conn, "new.html", changeset: changeset)
    end
  end
end
```
- Explain context architecture principles
- Show maintainability impact

**Category 3: LiveView Lifecycle Errors**
- State management anti-patterns
- Event handling mistakes
- Socket struct passing to business logic

**Category 4: Functional vs Imperative Conflicts**
- Preferring if/else over pattern matching
- Missing guard clauses
- Ignoring pipe operator conventions

**The Pattern:**
- AI generates code that compiles
- Code works for immediate test case
- Code violates architectural principles
- Technical debt accumulates silently

**Transition:**
- "Next week I'll share architectural patterns that work WITH AI instead of against it"
- "These patterns are how successful teams are managing to use AI effectively"

**Call to Action:**
- "Which of these have you encountered?"
- "Are there other patterns I missed?"
- Encourage bookmarking/sharing

### Source Material
- `/docs/personas/elixir_developers.md` AI tool failures section
- Stack Overflow examples
- GitHub Copilot community discussions
- Real code examples (anonymized)

### Success Metrics
- Saved/bookmarked by community
- Shared on Twitter by community members
- Longer comment threads discussing solutions
- Requests for "part 3"

## Week 3: The Architecture Solution

### Title Options
1. "How structured session workflows prevent AI from generating Phoenix spaghetti code"
2. "Architectural patterns that work WITH AI tools instead of against them"
3. "The modular monolith + vertical slice approach to AI-assisted Elixir development"

**Recommended:** Option 1 (introduces your unique approach without being product-focused)

### Content Structure

**Introduction:**
- Recap Week 1 (problem) and Week 2 (patterns)
- Transition: "So what actually works?"
- Not about avoiding AI, but structuring its use

**Core Principle: Constrained Generation**
- AI excels within boundaries
- Fails when given too much freedom
- Solution: Session-based workflows with approval gates

**Pattern 1: Session Orchestration**
```
Story → Component Design Session → Review Gate → Test Generation Session → Implementation
```
- Each step has clear inputs/outputs
- AI generates within defined scope
- Human approves architectural decisions
- Traceability from requirements through code

**Pattern 2: Component Type Classification**
- Contexts, Repositories, Schemas, LiveViews, etc.
- Each type has specific architectural rules
- AI generates appropriate patterns per type
- Enforces Phoenix conventions automatically

**Pattern 3: Dependency Tracking**
- Explicit component relationships
- Prevents circular dependencies
- Guides AI toward proper boundaries
- Makes refactoring safer

**Pattern 4: Vertical Slices**
- Group by feature, not layer
- High cohesion within slices
- Clear boundaries between slices
- AI can work independently per slice

**Pattern 5: Test-First Workflows**
- Generate tests before implementation
- Tests define contracts
- AI implementation must satisfy tests
- Early detection of architectural drift

**Why This Works:**
- Limits AI context window problems
- Enforces human-defined architecture
- Maintains traceability
- Catches errors early

**Real-World Application:**
- How to implement in existing projects
- Tools that support this approach
- Team workflow changes needed

**Transition:**
- "I've built tooling around these patterns - launching next week"
- "These principles work regardless of tools"
- Invite early interest: "DM if you want beta access"

### Source Material
- `/docs/executive_summary.md` architecture sections
- `/docs/content/design_driven_code_generation.md`
- `/docs/content/control_over_prompts.md`
- `/docs/problem_statement.md` section 4 (architectural patterns)

### Success Metrics
- High engagement (comments, upvotes)
- DMs requesting beta access
- Questions about implementation details
- Community discussion of similar approaches

## Week 4: The Launch Post

### Title Options
1. "I built an AI-SDLC platform for Phoenix/LiveView after 6 months researching AI code quality [Show HN style]"
2. "CodeMySpec: Structured AI-assisted development for Elixir/Phoenix (with 6 months of research)"
3. "Show r/elixir: Process-guided AI development for Phoenix with session orchestration and MCP integration"

**Recommended:** Option 1 (Show HN style resonates with developer communities)

### Content Structure

**Opening:**
- "Three weeks ago I shared research showing AI code quality problems"
- "Then I showed specific Elixir/Phoenix pattern failures"
- "Last week I outlined architectural patterns that work WITH AI"
- "Today I'm launching the platform I built around these principles"

**The Problem (Brief Recap):**
- AI generates code that compiles but violates architecture
- Particularly bad for functional languages and Phoenix patterns
- Technical debt accumulating faster than ever
- Existing tools don't understand Elixir idioms

**The Solution: CodeMySpec**

What it is:
- Phoenix/LiveView application for managing AI-assisted development workflows
- Session-based orchestration (component design, test generation)
- MCP server integration for Claude Code/Desktop
- Component architecture tracking with dependency management

How it works:
1. Define user stories in web UI
2. Create component architecture with types and dependencies
3. AI agents (via MCP) generate component designs within constraints
4. Human approval gates for architectural decisions
5. AI generates tests based on approved designs
6. Traceability from stories → components → tests → code

**Technical Architecture:**
- Built in Phoenix (dogfooding)
- Hermes MCP servers expose Stories and Components APIs
- Session orchestration through discrete steps
- Multi-tenant with OAuth2 for agent access
- Git-based content sync

**What Makes It Different:**
- Elixir/Phoenix-first (not generic)
- Process-guided (not just "better prompts")
- Human-in-the-loop at architectural decision points
- Maintains traceability and audit trail
- Enforces Phoenix context boundaries

**Current Status:**
- Working beta
- Used internally for own development (dogfooding)
- MCP integration tested with Claude Code
- Looking for early adopters

**Who It's For:**
- Elixir agencies managing client projects
- Teams building Phoenix applications with AI assistance
- Developers frustrated with current AI tool output
- Anyone who values architecture over speed

**Next Steps:**
- Beta access: [link]
- GitHub: [link]
- Documentation: [link]
- Demo video: [link if available]

**Open Discussion:**
- "I know this is opinionated architecture"
- "Happy to discuss trade-offs, alternative approaches"
- "What am I missing?"
- "What would make this more useful?"
