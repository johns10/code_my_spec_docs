# Campaign 5: The Journey Series - "How I Learned to Control AI Code Generation"

## Objective

Tell the authentic story of discovering and refining design-driven AI development through a series of educational posts that teach the manual process first, then show how each tedious part was automated. Position the product as the natural evolution of proven techniques rather than a theoretical solution.

## Philosophy

**Main Quest + Side Quests Structure**

- **Main Quest Posts**: Teach the manual process anyone can do today with just markdown files and AI chat
- **Side Quest Posts**: Show the automation for those ready to go deeper (MCP servers, Phoenix architecture, session orchestration)
- **Product Emergence**: CodeMySpec revealed as the culmination of automating all the tedious parts

**Key Principle**: Give away the process completely. If readers do it manually forever, they still get massive value. Those who want automation will naturally seek it out.

## Timeline

8 weeks for complete series (4 main quest + 4 side quests)
Alternating weekly: Main Quest → Side Quest → Main Quest → Side Quest...

## Why This Works

### For Beginners
- Follow main quest only
- Immediately actionable (create markdown files today)
- Never need the product to succeed
- Build trust through education

### For Advanced Users
- Speed-run main quest
- Dive into technical side quests
- Learn MCP, Phoenix, agent architecture
- Decide: build their own or use CodeMySpec

### For You
- Authentic story demonstrates expertise
- Educational content builds authority
- Product reveal feels inevitable, not salesy
- Side quests = Campaign 2 (MCP education) content
- Main quests = Campaign 4 (Process documentation) content

## Cross-References Strategy

**In Main Quest Posts:**
```markdown
> This process works great, but copy-pasting gets tedious. If you want to automate it, check out [Side Quest 1A: Building an MCP Server]

> The complete automation of this workflow is available in [Side Quest 4A: CodeMySpec]
```

**In Side Quest Posts:**
```markdown
> This post assumes you've tried the manual process described in [Main Quest Post 1]. If you haven't, start there - it's important to understand the process before automating it.

> For the next piece of automation, see [Side Quest 2A: Components MCP Server]
```

**In Community Engagement (Campaign 3):**
```markdown
"I wrote about the manual approach here: [Main Quest Post 1]
And if you want automation: [Side Quest 1A]"

"This is exactly what I cover in my series on design-driven AI development: [link to series landing page]"
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues

**1. "This is just marketing disguised as education"**
Response:
- Lead with value, product reveal only at end
- Manual process works completely without product
- Open source MCP server components
- "Build your own" is valid option

**2. "Too complex for most developers"**
Response:
- Main quest is simple (just markdown files)
- Side quests are optional
- Start small: one feature
- Scale up gradually

**3. "Why not just [competitor]?"**
Response:
- Not competing, different approach
- Elixir/Phoenix specific
- Design-driven vs prompt-driven
- Different philosophy (human gates vs full automation)

**4. "MCP is too new/might change"**
Response:
- Manual process doesn't depend on MCP
- MCP is abstraction layer
- Will update as MCP evolves
- Principles remain valid

**5. "I tried Main Quest 1, it didn't work"**
Response:
- Engage deeply: What didn't work?
- Iterate on the process

## Conclusion

This campaign tells your authentic story through education. By teaching the manual process first and showing automation second, you build trust and demonstrate expertise. The product emerges as the natural conclusion of a proven workflow, not a theoretical solution.

The main quest + side quest structure lets readers choose their own adventure. Beginners get immediate value from simple markdown files. Advanced users dive into MCP servers and orchestration. Everyone learns, and those who want automation have a clear path.

Most importantly, this approach gives away your best ideas. That's counterintuitive but powerful: readers who implement your process manually become advocates. They understand the value because they've experienced it. When they want automation, they already know it works.

This is the long game, but it's the most authentic and ultimately most effective path for developer tools.
