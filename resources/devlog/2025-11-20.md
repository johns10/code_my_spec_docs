with most major features having comprehensive test coverage.

Project: Code My Spec VSCode Extension

What it is: A VSCode extension that enforces structured, test-driven development for Phoenix/LiveView apps by guiding AI agents through tight architectural boundaries instead of letting them design your architecture.

Recent Progress

Day 1 (28 hours ago):
- UI Improvements - Enhanced the session display interface:
- Added display_name field to session types for better labeling
- Improved session list view to show cleaner, more descriptive names
- Updated session webview to use display names and conditionally show component info
- Made the component name optional in the UI (better for non-component sessions)
- Added comprehensive publishing documentation to README (VSCode Marketplace workflow, PAT setup, complete checklist)

Day 2 (23 hours ago):
- Documentation & Release - Prepared for first public release:
- Set up docs as a git submodule for better organization
- Updated documentation content
- Bumped version from 0.0.1 → 0.0.2
- Updated VSCode engine requirement to 1.105.0

Key Philosophy

The work reflects the core principle: "Stop letting LLMs design your architecture." The extension provides scaffolding (user stories, component boundaries, test workflows) while Claude Code handles generation tasks within those constraints.

What's Next

The extension is now ready for its first marketplace release, with polished UI for session management and complete publishing documentation for future updates.
