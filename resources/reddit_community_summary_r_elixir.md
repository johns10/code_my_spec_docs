## Final Notes

This community deeply values:
- **Correctness** - Working code over theory
- **Stability** - Long-term maintainability
- **Pragmatism** - Right tool for the job
- **Depth** - Technical sophistication
- **Honesty** - Admitting limitations
- **Community** - Helping others learn

The r/elixir community is welcoming but expects substance. They're tired of JavaScript churn and appreciate Elixir's stability. They value real projects over demos, and production experience over theory.

When in doubt, ask yourself: "Would an experienced developer with 15 years of experience find this valuable and well-reasoned?" If yes, post it. If no, add more substance first.
