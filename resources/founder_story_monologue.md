I'm John Davenport. I'm originally from Huntsville, Alabama, and I got into entrepreneurship in 2010. I got involved with a group of people who were taking building automation software to market, and I went all in on that effort to the point of cashing out my 401k, going into terrible debt on my house and car because I wasn't paying mortgage payments.

I quit my job. I gave up everything and lost everything for a shot to do something entrepreneurial, and it didn't work out, and I did not get a big payoff from that. I realized in all of that that there was money to be made in software, and so I wanted to do software entrepreneurship.

So after I got done with that, I started teaching myself how to write Python, and I literally failed to ship anything for the next three years because even though I knew something about writing software, I didn't know anything about actually shipping applications. That kind of changed in 2019 when I got introduced to Elixir, and I was able to ship my first application.

It was called UserDocs. UserDocs was a tool for technical writers to automatically document web apps to capture screenshots. It was basically, you know, a layer on top of Cypress or Selenium that would go through and click on stuff and take screenshots, and it did not take off, and it was entirely because of distribution and because it was a B2B product, and I couldn't get any interest in it.

I did some content marketing on LinkedIn, but it just fell flat. It never went anywhere. So I eventually failed that one off, and I tried a couple of other things in between. The next major one was called Discuss It, and it was like an early LLM product that was trying to ingest phone calls and text messages from open phone and provide different kinds of summaries for different reasons.

And again, it was something else that, you know, I didn't get the distribution and marketing right, didn't get any interest, and it didn't go anywhere. And so ultimately, I just have this problem where I can't build and sell software products. And, you know, I've built other things in the meantime.

Over the last year, I've gotten super interested in large language models and how they could help me to finally be successful as a software engineer. You know, part of that is writing a software. And like, this is a problem that I have now had for almost 10 years is my inability to get a decent product stood up and out the door and marketed and sold.

And ever since I started working with LLMs, I was very interested in the idea that I could improve LLM use by providing a structured procedural framework for orchestrating the LLM. And this all goes back to like, you know, what are the first principles of software engineering? Well, in software engineering, you have a product manager who goes and talks to the customer and figures out what the customer needs and, you know, turns that into user stories.

And then you have an architect who decides the overall architecture and design of the application. And then you, you know, if you have a good engineer, they get that architecture and they design the individual modules and write the tests and code that implements them. And that's how you get a product.

And I thought that using LLMs should really be no different. You should have a structured process that defines how you specify, architect, design, and code the product. And so that's basically the way that I have built CodeMySpec is it's a tool that helps you create specifications, design architecture, design individual modules, and then write tests and implementation.

And it's got these structured workflows. It uses a fixed and specific architecture to, you know, make products in a scalable way. And what I want out of this product is to help other people who want to get into software engineering or, you know, software entrepreneurship to be successful, you know, building and selling their own products.

Like if I could, if that, that's my dream is to do this for myself by helping other people to do it. So that's why, that's why I created CodeMySpec.
