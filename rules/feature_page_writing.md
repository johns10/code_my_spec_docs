# Feature Page Writing

Write feature pages that follow a user-journey structure, focusing on clarity and digestibility over comprehensiveness.

## Core Structure

Each feature page should include:

1. **Problem Statement** (2-3 sentences) - What pain does this solve? Why does it matter?
2. **Solution Overview** (1 paragraph) - What the feature does and its key benefit
3. **How It Works** (3-5 concrete steps) - Actionable workflow showing the feature in use
4. **Key Capabilities** (Bulleted list) - Specific things users can accomplish
5. **Integration Points** (1 paragraph) - How this connects to other features in the workflow
6. **Getting Started** (Clear first action) - Lowest-friction way to try the feature

## Voice and Tone

- **Concise over comprehensive** - Marketing pages, not technical documentation
- **Benefits before features** - Lead with outcomes, support with capabilities
- **Concrete over abstract** - Show specific examples rather than describing concepts
- **Active and direct** - "AI interviews you" not "The system facilitates requirement gathering"

## Simplification Principles

- **Group related session types** - Present as "Design Workflows" rather than listing ContextDesignSessions, ComponentDesignSessions, etc.
- **Use familiar metaphors** - "Your AI Product Manager" is clearer than "Stories MCP Server"
- **Tier information** - Core journey first, differentiators second, technical details last
- **Assume progressive disclosure** - Link to deeper docs rather than explaining everything upfront

## Key Messaging Themes

Align feature descriptions with these principles from the executive summary:

- **Process over prompts** - Structured workflows guide AI, not open-ended generation
- **Human-guided AI** - Users control architecture, AI handles generation and implementation
- **Complete traceability** - Every artifact traces back to business requirements
- **Phoenix-native** - Follows community conventions automatically, not generic code generation
- **Fail-fast with review gates** - Catch issues early through approval workflows

## Content Flow

Features should be presented in user-journey order:

1. Requirements (Stories MCP) → 2. Architecture (Components MCP) → 3. Implementation (Session Workflows) → 4. Progress Tracking (Project Coordinator)

When describing a feature, reference where it fits in this journey and what comes before/after.
