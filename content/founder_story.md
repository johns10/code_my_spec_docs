# Why I Built CodeMySpec

In 2010, I cashed out my 401k, stopped paying my mortgage, quit my job, and went all-in on a building automation software startup.

How much did I make when it was over?

Nothing. Zero. Not a single dollar.

But I learned something important: there was money to be made in software. Real money. I just needed to figure out how to actually ship products.

So I started teaching myself Python. For the next **three years**, I failed to ship a single application. I could write code, sure. But shipping actual applications? That was a different skill entirely.

## Finally Shipping (But Still Not Succeeding)

In 2019, I discovered Elixir and finally shipped my first product: UserDocs. It was a tool that automatically documented web apps by capturing screenshots as it clicked through your application.

It worked perfectly. The code was solid. The product did exactly what it promised.

I got exactly zero customers.

I tried content marketing on LinkedIn. I reached out to potential users. Nothing stuck. Nobody cared.

Then I tried again with Discussit, an LLM product that ingested phone calls and texts and created intelligent summaries.

Same result. Great technology. Zero traction.

## The 10-Year Pattern

By this point, I'd spent almost a **decade** building software products that nobody wanted. Or maybe they wanted them. I just couldn't figure out distribution and marketing while also building the product.

I had a problem I couldn't solve on my own.

## Going Back to First Principles

Over the last year, I got obsessed with large language models. Not because they were trendy, but because I thought they might finally help me ship products successfully.

But here's the thing: just throwing prompts at an LLM doesn't work any better than throwing code at a problem without planning.

I started thinking about how real software teams actually work:

- Product managers create specifications based on customer needs
- Architects design the overall system
- Engineers design modules, write tests, and implement features

This process exists for a reason. It works. So why was I (and everyone else) just having unstructured conversations with LLMs and hoping for the best?

## Building the Tool I Needed

That's when I built CodeMySpec.

It's a structured framework that guides you through specifying, architecting, designing, and coding. It uses LLMs at each stage, but with a clear process that actually works.

No more random prompting. No more starting over because you didn't think through the architecture. No more feeling lost halfway through implementation.

Just a clear path from "I have an idea" to "I shipped something that works."

## Why I'm Sharing This

After 15 years in enterprise systems and 2 years working specifically with LLM-assisted development, I've realized something:

**I don't want you to spend 10 years learning what I learned.**

If you're trying to build and ship software products. Whether you're an aspiring engineer, a solo entrepreneur, or someone with an idea but no technical background. CodeMySpec is designed to help you succeed without the decade of pain I went through.

I built it because I needed it to exist. Now I'm sharing it because your success is how I finally achieve mine.
