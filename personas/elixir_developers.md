# Elixir developers and AI coding tools frustrations

The Elixir developer community presents a compelling opportunity for building better AI-assisted development tools. While Elixir ranks as the **3rd most admired programming language** in 2024-2025 surveys, developers face significant frustrations with current AI coding tools that fundamentally misunderstand functional programming patterns.

## Community landscape reveals engaged, quality-focused developers

The Elixir community demonstrates remarkable engagement and growth, with the **Elixir Forum reaching 100 million pageviews in 2025**. Key platforms include the official Elixir Forum (2 million monthly pageviews), Discord servers with 19K+ members, Reddit r/elixir, and active Twitter discussions using #MyElixirStatus.

**Prominent community leaders** driving technical discourse include José Valim (Elixir creator, 52.8K Twitter followers), Chris McCord (Phoenix creator), Bruce Tate (Groxio CEO), and Sophie DeBenedetto (GitHub engineer, Elixir Series Editor). These leaders regularly share insights about development practices and actively shape community conversations about tooling improvements.

The community exhibits **senior-heavy demographics** with 74% identifying as senior developers, suggesting experienced professionals who value quality and architectural principles. Major conferences like ElixirConf US and EU consistently attract 800+ attendees, with trending topics including LiveView evolution, type systems, AI/ML integration, and production scaling stories.

**Leading companies** using Elixir include Discord (handling 26M WebSocket events/second), Netflix, Pinterest, and DockYard, which regularly share production experiences and advocate for better tooling. This corporate backing provides credibility for discussions about development efficiency and AI assistance.

## AI tool failures reveal systematic pattern understanding gaps

Research uncovered specific, documented failures where AI coding tools fundamentally misunderstand Elixir's functional programming paradigms and ecosystem conventions.

**OTP pattern misunderstandings** represent the most critical failure category. GitHub Copilot frequently confuses Ruby and Elixir syntax, with developers reporting: *"copilot doesn't understand when I'm coding in Elixir or Ruby because the copilot suggests code ruby for elixir, often is wrong."* ChatGPT generates invalid Elixir code with duplicate default values, repeatedly making the same compilation errors even after correction.

**Phoenix context violations** occur consistently with outdated framework knowledge. Developers report ChatGPT using deprecated Phoenix 1.6 syntax like `<%= example %>` instead of current Phoenix 1.7 syntax `{example}`, causing immediate compilation errors. AI tools violate architectural boundaries by misusing functions like `assign/3` instead of `assign_prop/3` in controllers, breaking Phoenix's contextual design patterns.

**Functional versus imperative conflicts** emerge as a core philosophical issue. Paul Fedory documented that AI models *"don't often generate idiomatic Elixir unless explicitly prompted to rewrite the code in a specific way. For example, I've noticed it prefers standard control structures (e.g., if/else, case) over function clauses with guards."* This represents a fundamental bias toward imperative patterns that conflicts with Elixir's functional elegance.

**LiveView-specific failures** highlight the challenges with newer framework features. Developer kigila noted: *"Chat GPT have no clue about these new features in the latest releases."* AI tools struggle particularly with LiveView event handling, state management patterns, and the specialized Inertia adapter integration, reflecting insufficient training data on Elixir's innovative real-time web capabilities.

## Community strongly values educational technical content

Content engagement analysis reveals clear preferences that inform successful community building strategies. **ElixirWeekly** by René Föhring serves as the community's most trusted content curator, while **DockYard's blog** consistently generates high engagement with machine learning content and LiveView Native updates.

**Technical deep-dives consistently outperform** surface-level content. José Valim's posts about parallel compiler improvements and gradual typing announcements generate widespread Hacker News discussion. Real-world production case studies, particularly migration stories like "Bleacher Report reduced app servers from 150 to 8 after migrating from Rails to Phoenix," consistently go viral.

**Video content and podcasts** show strong engagement, with Thinking Elixir Podcast reaching 52K followers and Alchemist Camp building the largest free Elixir screencast library. The community values **project-based learning approaches** over isolated code snippets, preferring complete application walkthroughs that demonstrate architectural principles.

**Trending discussion topics** from 2023-2025 include machine learning integration (Nx, Bumblebee), LiveView Native mobile development, type system evolution, performance comparisons, and production case studies. The community actively discusses AI integration challenges, creating natural opportunities for content about improved AI tooling.

## Developer tooling gaps create urgency for solutions

Current development tooling reveals both strengths and critical pain points that amplify AI assistance needs. While developers praise **Mix build tool** and **ExUnit testing framework**, they face persistent challenges with **ElixirLS language server reliability**. Multiple developers report: *"ElixirLS has never worked quite right for me, or most other Elixir developers I know. It's often painfully slow to respond even in small projects, it often gets stuck in obscure failures that require an editor reload."*

**IDE support gaps** create particular frustration compared to mainstream languages. Developers note: *"Javascript, Typescript have immaculate tooling in this regard, same goes for Java. There is no IDE from JetBrains."* This tooling deficit makes AI assistance even more valuable when it works correctly.

**Development velocity challenges** emerge from manual workflows requiring frequent documentation lookups and compilation cycles. One developer described: *"My current problem is being too slow. I write a function and open iex shell... I change code and recompile(). After function works, to create another function I open browser check elixir docs."*

The community actively develops solutions through initiatives like **elixir-tools** and **Next LS**, demonstrating clear demand for improved development experience and openness to better tooling solutions.

## Community sentiment reveals opportunity amid concerns

Elixir developers express **cautious optimism** about AI coding assistance while voicing specific concerns about being left behind. The competitive pressure is real: *"People are just writing their boilerplate code, and even nuanced code lightning fast... Only catch is, it's usually Python or Javascript. I don't want to use those languages today, but I do want to ship apps ASAP."*

**Concerns about functional programming understanding** dominate discussions about AI limitations. Developers worry that *"models aren't quite there yet when it comes to understanding the broader Elixir ecosystem... they lack familiarity with some of the idiomatic patterns that make Elixir code elegant and concise."*

However, **measured AI adoption** shows promise. 70% of AI agent users report reduced time on specific tasks, with some developers finding Copilot *"better with elixir than with typescript."* The key challenge involves quality: *"The biggest single frustration, cited by 66% of developers, is dealing with 'AI solutions that are almost right, but not quite.'"*

**Strategic positioning opportunities** emerge from Elixir's architectural advantages. Developers recognize that *"Elixir's design philosophy and technical architecture make it uniquely suited for implementing robust, scalable agentic workflows,"* suggesting natural alignment between the language and AI system development.

## Content strategy recommendations for community building

**Lead with technical credibility** through detailed analysis of current AI tool failures. The community responds strongly to concrete examples and architectural discussions. Content addressing specific OTP pattern recognition, Phoenix context awareness, and functional programming bias will resonate with experienced developers who've encountered these problems.

**Emphasize productivity gains** while acknowledging quality concerns. Frame better AI tooling as solving the speed versus correctness trade-off that currently forces developers toward other languages. Position your tools as understanding both Elixir's unique patterns and the broader architectural principles that make the language powerful.

**Engage established content channels** including ElixirWeekly submission, Elixir Forum technical discussions, and conference speaking opportunities. The community trusts curated sources and values contributors who demonstrate deep technical understanding.

**Focus on educational value** by explaining not just what your AI tools do differently, but why functional programming patterns matter and how proper AI assistance preserves code quality. The community's senior-heavy demographics appreciate sophisticated technical explanations.

**Build relationships with community leaders** who regularly advocate for better tooling. José Valim, Chris McCord, and others actively discuss development efficiency improvements and would likely engage with genuinely superior AI coding assistance.

The research reveals a community experiencing rapid growth but constrained by tooling limitations. Developers want AI assistance that understands their language's unique strengths rather than fighting against them. This creates a compelling opportunity for AI tools that properly understand functional programming patterns, OTP principles, and modern Phoenix/LiveView development practices.
