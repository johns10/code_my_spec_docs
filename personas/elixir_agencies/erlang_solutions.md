# Erlang Solutions: Enterprise Consulting Intelligence

Erlang Solutions stands as the dominant global consultancy in the Erlang/Elixir ecosystem, serving Fortune 500 clients with mission-critical distributed systems while maintaining strong community influence through conferences and thought leadership. Founded in 1999, this 120-person firm has evolved from pure Erlang expertise into a comprehensive enterprise consulting practice that bridges legacy telecom systems with modern web applications, making them a prime target for enterprise development tooling solutions.

## Enterprise positioning built on scale and authority

Erlang Solutions deliberately positions itself for "the world's most ambitious companies," maintaining an impressive enterprise client roster including WhatsApp, Klarna, Goldman Sachs, PepsiCo, Adidas Runtastic, and Bleacher Report. Their **Fortune 500 focus** sets them apart from smaller Elixir consultancies, with documented success stories showing dramatic infrastructure savings - clients regularly reducing from 150 servers to 5 while scaling user bases into millions.

The company operates across eight global offices spanning London (headquarters), Stockholm, Krakow, Budapest, Berlin, San Francisco, Seattle, and Buenos Aires. As part of the Trifork Group since 2011, they leverage a broader ecosystem of 700+ employees across 16 countries, providing enterprise-scale credibility and 24/7 support capabilities that smaller consultancies cannot match.

Their service mix strategically balances **legacy Erlang modernization** (telecoms, financial infrastructure, ultra-high availability systems) with **modern Elixir/Phoenix development** (web applications, APIs, real-time systems). This dual expertise allows them to serve both established enterprises migrating from legacy systems and modern companies building new distributed architectures.

## Leadership combines technical authority with enterprise vision

**Francesco Cesarini**, founder and Technical Director, brings unparalleled credibility as an original Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory team member who started working with Erlang in 1995. His dual role as Oxford University lecturer and O'Reilly author (co-authored "Erlang Programming" and "Designing for Scalability") positions him as both technical authority and enterprise thought leader. Recent quotes reveal his perspective on enterprise adoption: "While Erlang is a powerful programming language, on its own, it's not enough to build complex reactive systems."

**Robert Virding**, Principal Language Expert and Erlang co-creator, provides ultimate technical validation. His presence on their team represents a competitive advantage no other consultancy can replicate, offering direct access to language design decisions and deep VM internals knowledge.

**Erik Schön**, Managing Director for Nordics, brings enterprise strategy expertise from 20+ years at Ericsson managing R&D organizations up to 400 people. His background in large-scale team management and Agile transformation addresses the exact challenges enterprise clients face when scaling Elixir development.

Regional business unit leaders like **Nico Gerpe** (Americas), **Joanna Wrona** (Krakow), and **Márton Veres** (London) demonstrate their global enterprise engagement model, enabling localized relationships with Fortune 500 decision-makers across time zones.

## Documented enterprise development methodologies reveal pain points

Erlang Solutions has developed sophisticated processes for enterprise-scale Elixir projects that reveal both their capabilities and underlying challenges. Their **distributed team coordination approach** spans multiple time zones with established remote work procedures, making them early adopters of distributed development practices that became mainstream post-2020.

Their quality assurance framework emphasizes **comprehensive code reviews** covering OTP compliance, bottleneck identification, style consistency, and functional design patterns. They document specific requirements: "Code reviews should be led by experienced developers focusing not only on quality, style, and documentation, but also on educating developers on the system as a whole."

**Team scaling guidelines** reveal their enterprise focus - they specify minimum team requirements of 4-5 people for small companies and 10-12+ developers for large enterprises. Their training philosophy emphasizes significant upfront investment: "If you want to save money and get your developers productive quickly, invest in proper training and mentorship, especially if you are ramping up a team of ten or more developers."

## Training-intensive approach highlights productivity challenges

Their documented training requirements reveal potential friction points in enterprise adoption. They cite Ericsson studies showing graduates become productive after "about a month" while **experienced developers require three months** despite intensive training. This productivity ramp-up challenge represents a significant enterprise cost center.

**Francesco Cesarini's warning** about inadequate training investment reveals a critical pain point: "We often see companies give their developers a book hoping they will become productive... If you go down the book route, don't be surprised if the project runs into trouble. By being penny wise and pound foolish, you'll scare away the Erlang/OTP experts, as they'll burn out spending all their time refactoring and debugging bad code."

Their emphasis on **mentorship requirements** - "It is best if the mentor can sit next to the new recruits, communication needs to be quick and efficient from both sides" - suggests current tooling lacks the guidance and knowledge transfer capabilities needed for enterprise-scale team onboarding.

## Limited AI tooling adoption creates opportunity

Despite their enterprise focus and scale challenges, Erlang Solutions shows minimal explicit engagement with AI-assisted development tools. Their recent content about AI focuses on business adoption rather than development productivity: "AI and ML can automate the mundane tasks people don't like doing, freeing them up for more creative activity."

Their **primary tooling innovation** remains WombatOAM, a monitoring and maintenance platform with recent machine learning integration for metric prediction. While positioned for enterprise scale ("tested on a cluster of 10,000+ Erlang VMs"), this focuses on operational excellence rather than development productivity.

The absence of AI coding assistant discussion in their extensive training and process documentation suggests **significant opportunity** for tools that could accelerate the 3-month developer onboarding timeline and reduce reliance on intensive human mentorship at enterprise scale.

## Market influence creates strategic partnership potential

Erlang Solutions wields substantial influence in enterprise Elixir adoption through conference organization and community leadership. They founded and organize the **Code Sync conference family** (Code BEAM America, Europe, Stockholm) and co-organize **ElixirConf Europe**, reaching thousands of developers annually and creating direct relationships with enterprise decision-makers.

Their **enterprise client testimonials** demonstrate strong relationship quality. Dave Marks from Bleacher Report: "Two CTOs I know who utilise Erlang both recommended Erlang Solutions." This referral-based growth indicates deep enterprise network integration and suggests they could be valuable partners for introducing AI-assisted development tools to the broader enterprise Elixir market.

## Strategic outreach recommendations

**Primary decision-makers** for tooling discussions include Francesco Cesarini (ultimate technical authority), Erik Schön (enterprise strategy), and regional business unit leaders for geographic market access. Technical influencers like Robert Virding (language ecosystem credibility) and Dmytro Lytovchenko (performance optimization) could provide validation for technically sophisticated tools.

**Optimal engagement themes** should focus on addressing their documented pain points: reducing the 3-month developer onboarding timeline, maintaining code quality across distributed teams, and scaling mentorship capabilities. Their emphasis on "proper training and mentorship" suggests AI tools positioned as **augmenting rather than replacing** human expertise would align with their philosophy.

**Timing considerations** should leverage their active conference schedule (ElixirConf 2025, Code BEAM events) and their stated frustrations with traditional training approaches. Their global expansion and enterprise client growth creates urgency around scaling development productivity without compromising quality.

The convergence of their enterprise client demands, documented scaling challenges, and limited AI tooling adoption creates a compelling opportunity for development productivity solutions that can demonstrate measurable impact on their core business challenges: faster developer onboarding, consistent code quality at scale, and sustainable team growth in the competitive Erlang/Elixir talent market.
