# ComponentDesignSession

## Purpose
Manages the multi-step workflow for creating design documentation for individual Phoenix context components through AI-assisted generation, without subsequent component scaffolding or dependency creation.

## Entity Ownership

This context owns no entities.

## Access Patterns
- All operations scoped by account_id through the Scope struct
- Session data filtered by project_id to ensure project-specific component documentation

## Public API
```elixir
# Session workflow delegation
@spec get_next_interaction(step_module_atom) :: {:ok, module()} | {:error, :session_complete | :invalid_interaction}
@spec steps() :: [module()]
```

## State Management Strategy
### Stateless Orchestration with Revision Loops
- All workflow state persisted through Sessions context
- Component documentation state maintained in Session.state field
- Workflow progress tracked via embedded Interactions in Session records
- Validation feedback stored in interaction results to drive revision decisions
- Revision iteration count tracked to prevent infinite loops

## Components
### ComponentDesignSessions.Orchestrator

| field | value |
| ----- | ----- |
| type  | other |

Stateless orchestrator managing the sequence of component documentation steps, determining workflow progression based on completed interactions. Handles revision loops by returning to ReviseDesign when validation fails.

### ComponentDesignSessions.Steps.Initialize

| field | value |
| ----- | ----- |
| type  | other |

Prepares the development environment and workspace for component documentation generation, setting up necessary directories and repository state.

### ComponentDesignSessions.Steps.GenerateComponentDesign

| field | value |
| ----- | ----- |
| type  | other |

Generates comprehensive component documentation using AI agents, applying design rules specific to component documentation patterns and architectural requirements.

### ComponentDesignSessions.Steps.ValidateDesign

| field | value |
| ----- | ----- |
| type  | other |

Validates the generated component documentation against project standards, design rules, and architectural constraints to ensure quality and consistency. Returns validation feedback that can trigger design revision loops.

### ComponentDesignSessions.Steps.ReviseDesign

| field | value |
| ----- | ----- |
| type  | other |

Revises component documentation based on validation feedback, engaging in iterative conversation with AI agents to address specific validation issues and design concerns.

### ComponentDesignSessions.Steps.Finalize

| field | value |
| ----- | ----- |
| type  | other |

Completes the component documentation session by persisting the final documentation and updating component metadata, without creating additional scaffolding or dependencies.

## Dependencies
- Sessions
- Rules
- Agents
- Components

## Execution Flow
1. **Initialize Environment**: Set up workspace and repository state for component documentation generation
2. **Generate Documentation**: Create comprehensive component documentation using AI agents with design rule application
3. **Validate Design**: Ensure documentation meets project standards and architectural requirements
   - If validation passes → proceed to Finalize
   - If validation fails → proceed to Revise Design with feedback
4. **Revise Design**: Address validation feedback through iterative AI conversation
   - Apply validation feedback to improve documentation
   - Return to Validate Design for re-evaluation
5. **Finalize Session**: Persist documentation and complete session without component scaffolding
