# CodeMySpec — Agent Workflow Guide

CodeMySpec is a requirements-driven development harness. It models your project as a
graph of **stories**, **components**, and **requirements**, then guides you through
building each piece in the right order: architecture → BDD spex → implementations → QA.

## Prerequisite: Phoenix project root

CodeMySpec is attached to a **Phoenix project root** — the folder containing
`mix.exs` with `:phoenix` in its deps. The harness reads `mix.exs`, walks
`lib/`, and writes rules and BDD files relative to that directory.
If a future session ever attaches to the wrong directory, the init checklist
surfaces it loudly; the user-side fix is to relaunch Claude Code from the
project root.

## Core Loop

```
get_next_requirement → start_task → do the work → (auto-evaluate) → repeat
```

### Step 1: Get Your Next Requirement

Call **`get_next_requirement`**. It syncs the filesystem, computes the requirement graph,
and returns the single highest-priority unsatisfied requirement whose prerequisites are met.

Three possible responses:
- **init_required** — project not linked yet. Follow the bootstrap checklist.
- **sync_required** — project exists but has no stories/components. Create them first.
- **next requirement** — the requirement to work on, with entity type, name, and ID.

### Step 2: Start the Task

Call **`start_task`** with the requirement's `requirement_name`, `entity_type`, and
`entity_id` (or `module_name` for components). This creates a task on your session and
returns a **detailed work prompt** containing:

- What to read (components, rules, existing code)
- The exact file path to write to
- Templates and format requirements
- Design rules and coding standards for the component type
- Similar components to reference for patterns

**Follow the prompt.** It is tailored to the specific component and requirement.

### Step 3: Do the Work

The requirement types you'll encounter, in dependency order:

| Requirement | What You Produce |
|---|---|
| `implementation_file` | Implementation code in `lib/` |
| `bdd_specs_exist` | BDD scenario files for a story's acceptance criteria |
| `bdd_specs_passing` | Fix failing story specifications |
| `qa_complete` | QA brief and results for a story |

### Step 4: Automatic Evaluation

When you finish (or the session stops), the harness evaluates your output:
- Does the file exist at the expected path?
- Does it parse/validate against the document schema?
- Do tests compile and pass?

If evaluation finds problems, you receive structured feedback. Fix and continue.

## MCP Tools Reference

### Requirements & Tasks
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_next_requirement` | Get the next thing to work on |
| `start_task` | Begin work — returns the detailed prompt |
| `list_requirements` | See all requirements and their status |
| `sync_project` | Re-sync filesystem state |
| `evaluate_task` | Manually trigger evaluation |
| `list_tasks` | See active/completed tasks |

### Stories & Architecture
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_stories` / `list_story_titles` | View user stories |
| `set_story_component` | Link a story to its surface component |
| `analyze_stories` | Analyze stories for architecture mapping |
| `validate_dependency_graph` | Check for circular dependencies |

### Issues
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_issues` / `get_issue` | View issues |
| `create_issue` | Report a new issue |
| `accept_issue` / `dismiss_issue` | Triage incoming issues |
| `resolve_issue` | Mark an issue as fixed |

### Bootstrap (first-time setup)
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_projects` | See available projects |
| `init_project` | Link this directory to a project |
| `install_claude_md` | Create/update CLAUDE.md managed section |
| `install_agents_md` | Create/update this file |
| `install_rules` | Copy design and test rules |

## HTTP Endpoints (not MCP tools)

Two things the harness does over plain HTTP rather than MCP, because both
can run for minutes and MCP caps a request at 30 seconds.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST localhost:4004/api/harnesses/<working_copy_id>/analysis/run` | Run one analyzer (`compiler`/`credo`/`exunit`/`spex`). The PreToolUse hook rewrites your `mix test` into this, so you rarely call it yourself. |
| `POST localhost:4004/api/harnesses/<working_copy_id>/analysis/wait` | Block until the background analyzers are idle, then report each source's state and problem count. |

**Run the wait in the background.** A full sweep on a large project takes
200-590 seconds; fire it as a background command and you will be notified
when it returns, rather than sitting on the call.

Use it when a stop is refused with "Background analysis is still running" —
the refusal includes the exact command with your harness id filled in. The
stop hook decides from persisted problems, so waiting is how you get a stop
evaluated against fresh results rather than the previous sweep's.

This used to be an MCP tool called `await_analysis`. It could not work: a
sweep outlives MCP's 30s request cap, so it answered
`-32603 Server unavailable` every time it was actually needed — which reads
as the server being down rather than as a timeout. If you find that name in
an older prompt, the prompt is stale.

## Component Types

The harness supports these component types, each with their own requirement
chain and design rules:

- **context** — Domain boundary with public API (`.code_my_spec/rules/context_design.md`)
- **schema** — Data structure with validation (`.code_my_spec/rules/schema_design.md`)
- **repository** — Data access layer (`.code_my_spec/rules/repository_design.md`)
- **liveview** — Phoenix LiveView page (`.code_my_spec/rules/liveview_design.md`)
- **liveview_component** — Reusable LiveView component (`.code_my_spec/rules/liveview_component_design.md`)
- **live_context** — LiveView grouping (only its children are built)
- **controller** — Phoenix HTTP handler
- **genserver** — Stateful process
- **task** — Background job
- **behaviour** — Callback definition

General Elixir rules: `.code_my_spec/rules/elixir_design.md`, `.code_my_spec/rules/elixir_test.md`

## Key Principles

1. **The graph is the plan.** Don't decide what to work on — ask `get_next_requirement`.
2. **Behaviour before code.** A story's acceptance criteria become BDD spex first;
   the implementation makes them pass. Components are designed as records, not files.
3. **Read the task prompt.** It contains everything you need: templates, rules, file paths,
   and patterns from similar components.
4. **One requirement at a time.** Complete it, let evaluation run, then get the next one.
5. **Issues are first-class.** If you find a problem, create an issue. Don't fix unrelated
   things inline.
