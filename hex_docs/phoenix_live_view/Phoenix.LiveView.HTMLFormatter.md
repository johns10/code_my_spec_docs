# Phoenix.LiveView.HTMLFormatter

Format HEEx templates from `.heex` files or `~H` sigils.

This is a `mix format` [plugin](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/main/Mix.Tasks.Format.html#module-plugins).

## Setup

Add it as a plugin to your `.formatter.exs` file and make sure to put
the `heex` extension in the `inputs` option.

```elixir
[
  plugins: [Phoenix.LiveView.HTMLFormatter],
  inputs: ["*.{heex,ex,exs}", "priv/*/seeds.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{heex,ex,exs}"],
  # ...
]
```

> ### For umbrella projects {: .info}
>
> In umbrella projects you must also change two files at the umbrella root,
> add `:phoenix_live_view` to your `deps` in the `mix.exs` file
> and add `plugins: [Phoenix.LiveView.HTMLFormatter]` in the `.formatter.exs` file.
> This is because the formatter does not attempt to load the dependencies of
> all children applications.

### Editor support

Most editors that support `mix format` integration should automatically format
`.heex` and `~H` templates. Other editors may require custom integration or
even provide additional functionality. Here are some reference posts:

  * [Formatting HEEx templates in VS Code](https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/formatting-heex-templates-in-vscode)

## Options

  * `:line_length` - The Elixir formatter defaults to a maximum line length
    of 98 characters, which can be overwritten with the `:line_length` option
    in your `.formatter.exs` file.

  * `:heex_line_length` - change the line length only for the HEEx formatter.

    ```elixir
    [
      # ...omitted
      heex_line_length: 300
    ]
    ```

  * `:migrate_eex_to_curly_interpolation` - Automatically migrate single expression
    `<%= ... %>` EEx expression to the curly braces one. Defaults to true.

  * `:attribute_formatters` - Specify formatters for certain attributes.

    ```elixir
    [
      plugins: [Phoenix.LiveView.HTMLFormatter],
      attribute_formatters: %{class: ClassFormatter},
    ]
    ```

  * `:inline_matcher` - a list of regular expressions to determine if a component
    should be treated as inline.
    Defaults to `["link", "button"]`, which treats any component with `link`
    or `button` in its name as inline.
    Can be disabled by setting it to an empty list.

## Formatting

This formatter tries to be as consistent as possible with the Elixir formatter
and also take into account "block" and "inline" HTML elements.

In the past, HTML elements were categorized as either "block-level" or
"inline". While now these concepts are specified by CSS, the historical
distinction remains as it typically dictates the default browser rendering
behavior. In particular, adding or removing whitespace between the start and
end tags of a block-level element will not change the rendered output, while
it may for inline elements.

The following links further explain these concepts:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Inline-level_content

Given HTML like this:

```heex
  <section><h1>   <b>{@user.name}</b></h1></section>
```

It will be formatted as:

```heex
<section>
  <h1><b>{@user.name}</b></h1>
</section>
```

A block element will go to the next line, while inline elements will be kept in the current line
as long as they fit within the configured line length.

It will also keep inline elements in their own lines if you intentionally write them this way:

```heex
<section>
  <h1>
    <b>{@user.name}</b>
  </h1>
</section>
```

This formatter will place all attributes on their own lines when they do not all fit in the
current line. Therefore this:

```heex
<section id="user-section-id" class="sm:focus:block flex w-full p-3" phx-click="send-event">
  <p>Hi</p>
</section>
```

Will be formatted to:

```heex
<section
  id="user-section-id"
  class="sm:focus:block flex w-full p-3"
  phx-click="send-event"
>
  <p>Hi</p>
</section>
```

This formatter **does not** format Elixir expressions with `do...end`.
The content within it will be formatted accordingly though. Therefore, the given
input:

```eex
<%= live_redirect(
       to: "/my/path",
  class: "my class"
) do %>
        My Link
<% end %>
```

Will be formatted to

```eex
<%= live_redirect(
       to: "/my/path",
  class: "my class"
) do %>
  My Link
<% end %>
```

Note that only the text `My Link` has been formatted.

### Intentional new lines

The formatter will keep intentional new lines. However, the formatter will
always keep a maximum of one line break in case you have multiple ones:

```heex
<p>
  text


  text
</p>
```

Will be formatted to:

```heex
<p>
  text

  text
</p>
```

### Inline elements

We don't format inline elements when there is a text without whitespace before
or after the element. Otherwise it would compromise what is rendered adding
an extra whitespace.

The formatter will consider these tags as inline elements:

- `<a>`
- `<abbr>`
- `<acronym>`
- `<audio>`
- `<b>`
- `<bdi>`
- `<bdo>`
- `<big>`
- `<br>`
- `<button>`
- `<canvas>`
- `<cite>`
- `<code>`
- `<data>`
- `<datalist>`
- `<del>`
- `<dfn>`
- `<em>`
- `<embed>`
- `<i>`
- `<iframe>`
- `<img>`
- `<input>`
- `<ins>`
- `<kbd>`
- `<label>`
- `<map>`
- `<mark>`
- `<meter>`
- `<noscript>`
- `<object>`
- `<output>`
- `<picture>`
- `<progress>`
- `<q>`
- `<ruby>`
- `<s>`
- `<samp>`
- `<select>`
- `<slot>`
- `<small>`
- `<span>`
- `<strong>`
- `<sub>`
- `<sup>`
- `<svg>`
- `<template>`
- `<textarea>`
- `<time>`
- `<u>`
- `<tt>`
- `<var>`
- `<video>`
- `<wbr>`
- Tags/components that match the `:inline_matcher` option.

All other tags are considered block elements.

## Skip formatting

In case you don't want part of your HTML to be automatically formatted.
You can use the special `phx-no-format` attribute so that the formatter will
skip the element block. Note that this attribute will not be rendered.

Therefore:

```heex
<.textarea phx-no-format>My content</.textarea>
```

Will be kept as is your code editor, but rendered as:

```heex
<textarea>My content</textarea>
```
