# Plug.Exception

A protocol that extends exceptions to be status-code aware.

By default, it looks for an implementation of the protocol,
otherwise checks if the exception has the `:plug_status` field
or simply returns 500.

## actions(exception)

Receives an exception and returns the possible actions that could be triggered for that error.
Should return a list of actions in the following structure:

    %{
      label: "Text that will be displayed in the button",
      handler: {Module, :function, [args]}
    }

Where:

  * `label` a string/binary that names this action
  * `handler` a MFArgs that will be executed when this action is triggered

It will be rendered in the `Plug.Debugger` generated error page as buttons showing the `label`
that upon pressing executes the MFArgs defined in the `handler`.

## Examples

    defimpl Plug.Exception, for: ActionableExample do
      def actions(_), do: [%{label: "Print HI", handler: {IO, :puts, ["Hi!"]}}]
    end

## status(exception)

Receives an exception and returns its HTTP status code.

## actions/1

Receives an exception and returns the possible actions that could be triggered for that error.
Should return a list of actions in the following structure:

    %{
      label: "Text that will be displayed in the button",
      handler: {Module, :function, [args]}
    }

Where:

  * `label` a string/binary that names this action
  * `handler` a MFArgs that will be executed when this action is triggered

It will be rendered in the `Plug.Debugger` generated error page as buttons showing the `label`
that upon pressing executes the MFArgs defined in the `handler`.

## Examples

    defimpl Plug.Exception, for: ActionableExample do
      def actions(_), do: [%{label: "Print HI", handler: {IO, :puts, ["Hi!"]}}]
    end

## status/1

Receives an exception and returns its HTTP status code.

## t/0

All the types that implement this protocol.
