# Plug.ErrorHandler

A module to be used in your existing plugs in order to provide
error handling.

    defmodule AppRouter do
      use Plug.Router
      use Plug.ErrorHandler

      plug :match
      plug :dispatch

      get "/hello" do
        send_resp(conn, 200, "world")
      end

      @impl Plug.ErrorHandler
      def handle_errors(conn, %{kind: _kind, reason: _reason, stack: _stack}) do
        send_resp(conn, conn.status, "Something went wrong")
      end
    end

Once this module is used, a callback named `handle_errors/2` should
be defined in your plug. This callback will receive the connection
already updated with a proper status code for the given exception.
The second argument is a map containing:

  * the exception kind (`:throw`, `:error` or `:exit`),
  * the reason (an exception for errors or a term for others)
  * the stacktrace

After the callback is invoked, the error is re-raised.

It is advised to do as little work as possible when handling errors
and avoid accessing data like parameters and session, as the parsing
of those is what could have led the error to trigger in the first place.

Also notice that these pages are going to be shown in production. If
you are looking for error handling to help during development, consider
using `Plug.Debugger`.

**Note:** If this module is used with `Plug.Debugger`, it must be used
after `Plug.Debugger`.
