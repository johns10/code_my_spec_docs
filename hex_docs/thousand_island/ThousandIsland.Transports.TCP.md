# ThousandIsland.Transports.TCP

Defines a `ThousandIsland.Transport` implementation based on clear TCP sockets
as provided by Erlang's `:gen_tcp` module. For the most part, users of Thousand
Island will only ever need to deal with this module via `transport_options`
passed to `ThousandIsland` at startup time. A complete list of such options
is defined via the `t::gen_tcp.listen_option/0` type. This list can be somewhat
difficult to decipher; by far the most common value to pass to this transport
is the following:

* `ip`:  The IP to listen on. Can be specified as:
  * `{1, 2, 3, 4}` for IPv4 addresses
  * `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}` for IPv6 addresses
  * `:loopback` for local loopback
  * `:any` for all interfaces (i.e.: `0.0.0.0`)
  * `{:local, "/path/to/socket"}` for a Unix domain socket. If this option is used,
    the `port` option *must* be set to `0`

Unless overridden, this module uses the following default options:

```elixir
backlog: 1024,
nodelay: true,
send_timeout: 30_000,
send_timeout_close: true,
reuseaddr: true
```

The following options are required for the proper operation of Thousand Island
and cannot be overridden:

```elixir
mode: :binary,
active: false
```
