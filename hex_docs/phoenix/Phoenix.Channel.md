# Phoenix.Channel

Defines a Phoenix Channel.

Channels provide a means for bidirectional communication from clients that
integrate with the `Phoenix.PubSub` layer for soft-realtime functionality.

For a conceptual overview, see the [Channels guide](channels.html).

## Topics & Callbacks

Every time you join a channel, you need to choose which particular topic you
want to listen to. The topic is just an identifier, but by convention it is
often made of two parts: `"topic:subtopic"`. Using the `"topic:subtopic"`
approach pairs nicely with the `Phoenix.Socket.channel/3` allowing you to
match on all topics starting with a given prefix by using a splat (the `*`
character) as the last character in the topic pattern:

    channel "room:*", MyAppWeb.RoomChannel

Any topic coming into the router with the `"room:"` prefix would dispatch
to `MyAppWeb.RoomChannel` in the above example. Topics can also be pattern
matched in your channels' `join/3` callback to pluck out the scoped pattern:

    # handles the special `"lobby"` subtopic
    def join("room:lobby", _payload, socket) do
      {:ok, socket}
    end

    # handles any other subtopic as the room ID, for example `"room:12"`, `"room:34"`
    def join("room:" <> room_id, _payload, socket) do
      {:ok, socket}
    end

The first argument is the topic, the second argument is a map payload given by
the client, and the third argument is an instance of `Phoenix.Socket`. The
`socket` is provided to all channel callbacks, so check its module and
documentation to learn its fields and the different ways to interact with it.

## Authorization

Clients must join a channel to send and receive PubSub events on that channel.
Your channels must implement a `join/3` callback that authorizes the socket
for the given topic. For example, you could check if the user is allowed to
join that particular room.

To authorize a socket in `join/3`, return `{:ok, socket}`.
To refuse authorization in `join/3`, return `{:error, reply}`.

## Incoming Events

After a client has successfully joined a channel, incoming events from the
client are routed through the channel's `handle_in/3` callbacks. Within these
callbacks, you can perform any action. Incoming callbacks must return the
`socket` to maintain ephemeral state.

Typically you'll either forward a message to all listeners with
`broadcast!/3` or reply directly to a client event for request/response style
messaging.

General message payloads are received as maps:

    def handle_in("new_msg", %{"uid" => uid, "body" => body}, socket) do
      ...
      {:reply, :ok, socket}
    end

Binary data payloads are passed as a `{:binary, data}` tuple:

    def handle_in("file_chunk", {:binary, chunk}, socket) do
      ...
      {:reply, :ok, socket}
    end

## Broadcasts

You can broadcast events from anywhere in your application to a topic by
the `broadcast` function in the endpoint:

    MyAppWeb.Endpoint.broadcast!("room:13", "new_message", %{content: "hello"})

It is also possible to broadcast directly from channels. Here's an example of
receiving an incoming `"new_msg"` event from one client, and broadcasting the
message to all topic subscribers for this socket.

    def handle_in("new_msg", %{"uid" => uid, "body" => body}, socket) do
      broadcast!(socket, "new_msg", %{uid: uid, body: body})
      {:noreply, socket}
    end

## Replies

Replies are useful for acknowledging a client's message or responding with
the results of an operation. A reply is sent only to the client connected to
the current channel process. Behind the scenes, they include the client
message `ref`, which allows the client to correlate the reply it receives
with the message it sent.

For example, imagine creating a resource and replying with the created record:

    def handle_in("create:post", attrs, socket) do
      changeset = Post.changeset(%Post{}, attrs)

      if changeset.valid? do
        post = Repo.insert!(changeset)
        response = MyAppWeb.PostView.render("show.json", %{post: post})
        {:reply, {:ok, response}, socket}
      else
        response = MyAppWeb.ChangesetView.render("errors.json", %{changeset: changeset})
        {:reply, {:error, response}, socket}
      end
    end

Or you may just want to confirm that the operation succeeded:

    def handle_in("create:post", attrs, socket) do
      changeset = Post.changeset(%Post{}, attrs)

      if changeset.valid? do
        Repo.insert!(changeset)
        {:reply, :ok, socket}
      else
        {:reply, :error, socket}
      end
    end

Binary data is also supported with replies via a `{:binary, data}` tuple:

    {:reply, {:ok, {:binary, bin}}, socket}

If you don't want to send a reply to the client, you can return:

    {:noreply, socket}

One situation when you might do this is if you need to reply later; see
`reply/2`.

## Pushes

Calling `push/3` allows you to send a message to the client which is not a
reply to a specific client message. Because it is not a reply, a pushed
message does not contain a client message `ref`; there is no prior client
message to relate it to.

Possible use cases include notifying a client that:
- You've auto-saved the user's document
- The user's game is ending soon
- The IoT device's settings should be updated

For example, you could `push/3` a message to the client in `handle_info/3`
after receiving a `PubSub` message relevant to them.

    alias Phoenix.Socket.Broadcast
    def handle_info(%Broadcast{topic: _, event: event, payload: payload}, socket) do
      push(socket, event, payload)
      {:noreply, socket}
    end

Push data can be given in the form of a map or a tagged `{:binary, data}`
tuple:

    # client asks for their current rank. reply contains it, and client
    # is also pushed a leader board and a badge image
    def handle_in("current_rank", _, socket) do
      push(socket, "leaders", %{leaders: Game.get_leaders(socket.assigns.game_id)})
      push(socket, "badge", {:binary, File.read!(socket.assigns.badge_path)})
      {:reply, %{val: Game.get_rank(socket.assigns[:user])}, socket}
    end

Note that in this example, `push/3` is called from `handle_in/3`; in this way
you can essentially reply N times to a single message from the client. See
`reply/2` for why this may be desirable.

## Intercepting Outgoing Events

When an event is broadcasted with `broadcast/3`, each channel subscriber can
choose to intercept the event and have their `handle_out/3` callback triggered.
This allows the event's payload to be customized on a socket by socket basis
to append extra information, or conditionally filter the message from being
delivered. If the event is not intercepted with `Phoenix.Channel.intercept/1`,
then the message is pushed directly to the client:

    intercept ["new_msg", "user_joined"]

    # for every socket subscribing to this topic, append an `is_editable`
    # value for client metadata.
    def handle_out("new_msg", msg, socket) do
      push(socket, "new_msg", Map.merge(msg,
        %{is_editable: User.can_edit_message?(socket.assigns[:user], msg)}
      ))
      {:noreply, socket}
    end

    # do not send broadcasted `"user_joined"` events if this socket's user
    # is ignoring the user who joined.
    def handle_out("user_joined", msg, socket) do
      unless User.ignoring?(socket.assigns[:user], msg.user_id) do
        push(socket, "user_joined", msg)
      end
      {:noreply, socket}
    end

## Terminate

On termination, the channel callback `terminate/2` will be invoked with
the error reason and the socket.

If we are terminating because the client left, the reason will be
`{:shutdown, :left}`. Similarly, if we are terminating because the
client connection was closed, the reason will be `{:shutdown, :closed}`.

If any of the callbacks return a `:stop` tuple, it will also
trigger terminate with the reason given in the tuple.

`terminate/2`, however, won't be invoked in case of errors nor in
case of exits. This is the same behaviour as you find in Elixir
abstractions like `GenServer` and others. Similar to `GenServer`,
it would also be possible to `:trap_exit` to guarantee that `terminate/2`
is invoked. This practice is not encouraged though.

Generally speaking, if you want to clean something up, it is better to
monitor your channel process and do the clean up from another process.
All channel callbacks, including `join/3`, are called from within the
channel process. Therefore, `self()` in any of them returns the PID to
be monitored.

## Exit reasons when stopping a channel

When the channel callbacks return a `:stop` tuple, such as:

    {:stop, :shutdown, socket}
    {:stop, {:error, :enoent}, socket}

the second argument is the exit reason, which follows the same behaviour as
standard `GenServer` exits.

You have three options to choose from when shutting down a channel:

  * `:normal` - in such cases, the exit won't be logged and linked processes
    do not exit

  * `:shutdown` or `{:shutdown, term}` - in such cases, the exit won't be
    logged and linked processes exit with the same reason unless they're
    trapping exits

  * any other term - in such cases, the exit will be logged and linked
    processes exit with the same reason unless they're trapping exits

## Subscribing to external topics

Sometimes you may need to programmatically subscribe a socket to external
topics in addition to the internal `socket.topic`. For example,
imagine you have a bidding system where a remote client dynamically sets
preferences on products they want to receive bidding notifications on.
Instead of requiring a unique channel process and topic per
preference, a more efficient and simple approach would be to subscribe a
single channel to relevant notifications via your endpoint. For example:

    defmodule MyAppWeb.Endpoint.NotificationChannel do
      use Phoenix.Channel

      def join("notification:" <> user_id, %{"ids" => ids}, socket) do
        topics = for product_id <- ids, do: "product:#{product_id}"

        {:ok, socket
              |> assign(:topics, [])
              |> put_new_topics(topics)}
      end

      def handle_in("watch", %{"product_id" => id}, socket) do
        {:reply, :ok, put_new_topics(socket, ["product:#{id}"])}
      end

      def handle_in("unwatch", %{"product_id" => id}, socket) do
        {:reply, :ok, MyAppWeb.Endpoint.unsubscribe("product:#{id}")}
      end

      defp put_new_topics(socket, topics) do
        Enum.reduce(topics, socket, fn topic, acc ->
          topics = acc.assigns.topics
          if topic in topics do
            acc
          else
            :ok = MyAppWeb.Endpoint.subscribe(topic)
            assign(acc, :topics, [topic | topics])
          end
        end)
      end
    end

Note: the caller must be responsible for preventing duplicate subscriptions.
After calling `subscribe/1` from your endpoint, the same flow applies to
handling regular Elixir messages within your channel. Most often, you'll
simply relay the `%Phoenix.Socket.Broadcast{}` event and payload:

    alias Phoenix.Socket.Broadcast
    def handle_info(%Broadcast{topic: _, event: event, payload: payload}, socket) do
      push(socket, event, payload)
      {:noreply, socket}
    end

## Hibernation

From Erlang/OTP 20, channels automatically hibernate to save memory
after 15_000 milliseconds of inactivity. This can be customized by
passing the `:hibernate_after` option to `use Phoenix.Channel`:

    use Phoenix.Channel, hibernate_after: 60_000

You can also set it to `:infinity` to fully disable it.

## Shutdown

You can configure the shutdown behavior of each channel used when your
application is shutting down by setting the `:shutdown` value on use:

    use Phoenix.Channel, shutdown: 5_000

It defaults to 5_000. The supported values are described under the
in the `Supervisor` module docs.

## Logging

By default, channel `"join"` and `"handle_in"` events are logged, using
the level `:info` and `:debug`, respectively. You can change the level used
for each event, or disable logs, per event type by setting the `:log_join`
and `:log_handle_in` options when using `Phoenix.Channel`. For example, the
following configuration logs join events as `:info`, but disables logging for
incoming events:

    use Phoenix.Channel, log_join: :info, log_handle_in: false

Note that changing an event type's level doesn't affect what is logged,
unless you set it to `false`, it affects the associated level.

## broadcast(socket, event, message)

Broadcast an event to all subscribers of the socket topic.

The event's message must be a serializable map or a tagged `{:binary, data}`
tuple where `data` is binary data.

## Examples

    iex> broadcast(socket, "new_message", %{id: 1, content: "hello"})
    :ok

    iex> broadcast(socket, "new_message", {:binary, "hello"})
    :ok

## broadcast!(socket, event, message)

Same as `broadcast/3`, but raises if broadcast fails.

## broadcast_from(socket, event, message)

Broadcast event from pid to all subscribers of the socket topic.

The channel that owns the socket will not receive the published
message. The event's message must be a serializable map or a tagged
`{:binary, data}` tuple where `data` is binary data.

## Examples

    iex> broadcast_from(socket, "new_message", %{id: 1, content: "hello"})
    :ok

    iex> broadcast_from(socket, "new_message", {:binary, "hello"})
    :ok

## broadcast_from!(socket, event, message)

Same as `broadcast_from/3`, but raises if broadcast fails.

## push(socket, event, message)

Sends an event directly to the connected client without requiring a prior
message from the client.

The event's message must be a serializable map or a tagged `{:binary, data}`
tuple where `data` is binary data.

Note that unlike some in client libraries, this server-side `push/3` does not
return a reference. If you need to get a reply from the client and to
correlate that reply with the message you pushed, you'll need to include a
unique identifier in the message, track it in the Channel's state, have the
client include it in its reply, and examine the ref when the reply comes to
`handle_in/3`.

## Examples

    iex> push(socket, "new_message", %{id: 1, content: "hello"})
    :ok

    iex> push(socket, "new_message", {:binary, "hello"})
    :ok

## reply(socket_ref, status)

Replies asynchronously to a socket push.

The usual way of replying to a client's message is to return a tuple from `handle_in/3`
like:

    {:reply, {status, payload}, socket}

But sometimes you need to reply to a push asynchronously - that is, after
your `handle_in/3` callback completes. For example, you might need to perform
work in another process and reply when it's finished.

You can do this by generating a reference to the socket with `socket_ref/1`
and calling `reply/2` with that ref when you're ready to reply.

*Note*: A `socket_ref` is required so the `socket` itself is not leaked
outside the channel. The `socket` holds information such as assigns and
transport configuration, so it's important to not copy this information
outside of the channel that owns it.

Technically, `reply/2` will allow you to reply multiple times to the same
client message, and each reply will include the client message `ref`. But the
client may expect only one reply; in that case, `push/3` would be preferable
for the additional messages.

Payloads are serialized before sending with the configured serializer.

## Examples

    def handle_in("work", payload, socket) do
      Worker.perform(payload, socket_ref(socket))
      {:noreply, socket}
    end

    def handle_info({:work_complete, result, ref}, socket) do
      reply(ref, {:ok, result})
      {:noreply, socket}
    end

## socket_ref(socket)

Generates a `socket_ref` for an async reply.

See `reply/2` for example usage.

## intercept(events)

Defines which Channel events to intercept for `handle_out/3` callbacks.

By default, broadcasted events are pushed directly to the client, but
intercepting events gives your channel a chance to customize the event
for the client to append extra information or filter the message from being
delivered.

*Note*: intercepting events can introduce significantly more overhead if a
large number of subscribers must customize a message since the broadcast will
be encoded N times instead of a single shared encoding across all subscribers.

## Examples

    intercept ["new_msg"]

    def handle_out("new_msg", payload, socket) do
      push(socket, "new_msg", Map.merge(payload,
        is_editable: User.can_edit_message?(socket.assigns[:user], payload)
      ))
      {:noreply, socket}
    end

`handle_out/3` callbacks must return one of:

    {:noreply, Socket.t} |
    {:noreply, Socket.t, timeout | :hibernate} |
    {:stop, reason :: term, Socket.t}

## handle_call/3

Handle regular GenServer call messages.

See `c:GenServer.handle_call/3`.

## handle_cast/2

Handle regular GenServer cast messages.

See `c:GenServer.handle_cast/2`.

## handle_in/3

Handle incoming `event`s.

Payloads are serialized before sending with the configured serializer.

## Example

    def handle_in("ping", payload, socket) do
      {:reply, {:ok, payload}, socket}
    end

## handle_info/2

Handle regular Elixir process messages.

See `c:GenServer.handle_info/2`.

## handle_out/3

Intercepts outgoing `event`s.

See `intercept/1`.

## join/3

Handle channel joins by `topic`.

To authorize a socket, return `{:ok, socket}` or `{:ok, reply, socket}`. To
refuse authorization, return `{:error, reason}`.

Payloads are serialized before sending with the configured serializer.

## Example

    def join("room:lobby", payload, socket) do
      if authorized?(payload) do
        {:ok, socket}
      else
        {:error, %{reason: "unauthorized"}}
      end
    end

## terminate/2

Invoked when the channel process is about to exit.

See `c:GenServer.terminate/2`.
