# Phoenix.Socket

A socket implementation that multiplexes messages over channels.

`Phoenix.Socket` is used as a module for establishing a connection
between client and server. Once the connection is established,
the initial state is stored in the `Phoenix.Socket` struct.

The same socket can be used to receive events from different transports.
Phoenix supports `websocket` and `longpoll` options when invoking
`Phoenix.Endpoint.socket/3` in your endpoint. `websocket` is set by default
and `longpoll` can also be configured explicitly.

    socket "/socket", MyAppWeb.Socket, websocket: true, longpoll: false

The command above means incoming socket connections can be made via
a WebSocket connection. Incoming and outgoing events are routed to
channels by topic:

    channel "room:lobby", MyAppWeb.LobbyChannel

See `Phoenix.Channel` for more information on channels.

## Socket Behaviour

Socket handlers are mounted in Endpoints and must define two callbacks:

  * `connect/3` - receives the socket params, connection info if any, and
    authenticates the connection. Must return a `Phoenix.Socket` struct,
    often with custom assigns

  * `id/1` - receives the socket returned by `connect/3` and returns the
    id of this connection as a string. The `id` is used to identify socket
    connections, often to a particular user, allowing us to force disconnections.
    For sockets requiring no authentication, `nil` can be returned

## Examples

    defmodule MyAppWeb.UserSocket do
      use Phoenix.Socket

      channel "room:*", MyAppWeb.RoomChannel

      def connect(params, socket, _connect_info) do
        {:ok, assign(socket, :user_id, params["user_id"])}
      end

      def id(socket), do: "users_socket:#{socket.assigns.user_id}"
    end

    # Disconnect all user's socket connections and their multiplexed channels
    MyAppWeb.Endpoint.broadcast("users_socket:" <> user.id, "disconnect", %{})

## Socket fields

  * `:id` - The string id of the socket
  * `:assigns` - The map of socket assigns, default: `%{}`
  * `:channel` - The current channel module
  * `:channel_pid` - The channel pid
  * `:endpoint` - The endpoint module where this socket originated, for example: `MyAppWeb.Endpoint`
  * `:handler` - The socket module where this socket originated, for example: `MyAppWeb.UserSocket`
  * `:joined` - If the socket has effectively joined the channel
  * `:join_ref` - The ref sent by the client when joining
  * `:ref` - The latest ref sent by the client
  * `:pubsub_server` - The registered name of the socket's pubsub server
  * `:topic` - The string topic, for example `"room:123"`
  * `:transport` - An identifier for the transport, used for logging
  * `:transport_pid` - The pid of the socket's transport process
  * `:serializer` - The serializer for socket messages

## Using options

On `use Phoenix.Socket`, the following options are accepted:

  * `:log` - the default level to log socket actions. Defaults
    to `:info`. May be set to `false` to disable it

  * `:partitions` - each channel is spawned under a supervisor.
    This option controls how many supervisors will be spawned
    to handle channels. Defaults to the number of cores.

## Garbage collection

It's possible to force garbage collection in the transport process after
processing large messages. For example, to trigger such from your channels,
run:

    send(socket.transport_pid, :garbage_collect)

Alternatively, you can configure your endpoint socket to trigger more
fullsweep garbage collections more frequently, by setting the `:fullsweep_after`
option for websockets. See `Phoenix.Endpoint.socket/3` for more info.

## Client-server communication

The encoding of server data and the decoding of client data is done
according to a serializer, defined in `Phoenix.Socket.Serializer`.
By default, JSON encoding is used to broker messages to and from clients.

The serializer `decode!` function must return a `Phoenix.Socket.Message`
which is forwarded to channels except:

  * `"heartbeat"` events in the "phoenix" topic - should just emit an OK reply
  * `"phx_join"` on any topic - should join the topic
  * `"phx_leave"` on any topic - should leave the topic

Each message also has a `ref` field which is used to track responses.

The server may send messages or replies back. For messages, the
ref uniquely identifies the message. For replies, the ref matches
the original message. Both data-types also include a join_ref that
uniquely identifies the currently joined channel.

The `Phoenix.Socket` implementation may also send special messages
and replies:

  * `"phx_error"` - in case of errors, such as a channel process
    crashing, or when attempting to join an already joined channel

  * `"phx_close"` - the channel was gracefully closed

Phoenix ships with a JavaScript implementation of both websocket
and long polling that interacts with Phoenix.Socket and can be
used as reference for those interested in implementing custom clients.

## Custom sockets and transports

See the `Phoenix.Socket.Transport` documentation for more information on
writing your own socket that does not leverage channels or for writing
your own transports that interacts with other sockets.

## Custom channels

You can list any module as a channel as long as it implements
a `child_spec/1` function. The `child_spec/1` function receives
the caller as argument and it must return a child spec that
initializes a process.

Once the process is initialized, it will receive the following
message:

    {Phoenix.Channel, auth_payload, from, socket}

A custom channel implementation MUST invoke
`GenServer.reply(from, {:ok | :error, reply_payload})` during its
initialization with a custom `reply_payload` that will be sent as
a reply to the client. Failing to do so will block the socket forever.

A custom channel receives `Phoenix.Socket.Message` structs as regular
messages from the transport. Replies to those messages and custom
messages can be sent to the socket at any moment by building an
appropriate `Phoenix.Socket.Reply` and `Phoenix.Socket.Message`
structs, encoding them with the serializer and dispatching the
serialized result to the transport.

For example, to handle "phx_leave" messages, which is recommended
to be handled by all channel implementations, one may do:

    def handle_info(
          %Message{topic: topic, event: "phx_leave"} = message,
          %{topic: topic, serializer: serializer, transport_pid: transport_pid} = socket
        ) do
      send transport_pid, serializer.encode!(build_leave_reply(message))
      {:stop, {:shutdown, :left}, socket}
    end

A special message delivered to all channels is a Broadcast with
event "phx_drain", which is sent when draining the socket during
application shutdown. Typically it is handled by sending a drain
message to the transport, causing it to shutdown:

    def handle_info(
          %Broadcast{event: "phx_drain"},
          %{transport_pid: transport_pid} = socket
        ) do
      send(transport_pid, :socket_drain)
      {:stop, {:shutdown, :draining}, socket}
    end

We also recommend all channels to monitor the `transport_pid`
on `init` and exit if the transport exits. We also advise to rewrite
`:normal` exit reasons (usually due to the socket being closed)
to the `{:shutdown, :closed}` to guarantee links are broken on
the channel exit (as a `:normal` exit does not break links):

    def handle_info({:DOWN, _, _, transport_pid, reason}, %{transport_pid: transport_pid} = socket) do
      reason = if reason == :normal, do: {:shutdown, :closed}, else: reason
      {:stop, reason, socket}
    end

Any process exit is treated as an error by the socket layer unless
a `{:socket_close, pid, reason}` message is sent to the socket before
shutdown.

Custom channel implementations cannot be tested with `Phoenix.ChannelTest`.

## assign(socket, keyword_or_map)

Adds key/value pairs to socket assigns.
Accepts a keyword list, a map, or a single-argument function.

When a keyword list or map is provided, it will be merged into the existing assigns.

If a function is given, it takes the current assigns as an argument and its return
value will be merged into the current assigns.

## Examples

    iex> assign(socket, name: "Elixir", logo: "💧")
    iex> assign(socket, %{name: "Elixir"})
    iex> assign(socket, fn %{name: name, logo: logo} -> %{title: Enum.join([name, logo], " | ")} end)

## assign(socket, key, value)

Adds a `key`/`value` pair to `socket` assigns.

See also `assign/2` to add multiple key/value pairs.

## Examples

    iex> assign(socket, :name, "Elixir")

## channel(topic_pattern, module, opts \\ [])

Defines a channel matching the given topic and transports.

  * `topic_pattern` - The string pattern, for example `"room:*"`, `"users:*"`,
    or `"system"`
  * `module` - The channel module handler, for example `MyAppWeb.RoomChannel`
  * `opts` - The optional list of options, see below

## Options

  * `:assigns` - the map of socket assigns to merge into the socket on join

## Examples

    channel "topic1:*", MyChannel

## Topic Patterns

The `channel` macro accepts topic patterns in two flavors. A splat (the `*`
character) argument can be provided as the last character to indicate a
`"topic:subtopic"` match. If a plain string is provided, only that topic will
match the channel handler. Most use-cases will use the `"topic:*"` pattern to
allow more versatile topic scoping.

See `Phoenix.Channel` for more information

## connect/2

Shortcut version of `connect/3` which does not receive `connect_info`.

Provided for backwards compatibility.

## connect/3

Receives the socket params and authenticates the connection.

## Socket params and assigns

Socket params are passed from the client and can
be used to verify and authenticate a user. After
verification, you can put default assigns into
the socket that will be set for all channels, ie

    {:ok, assign(socket, :user_id, verified_user_id)}

To deny connection, return `:error` or `{:error, term}`. To control the
response the client receives in that case, [define an error handler in the
websocket
configuration](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Endpoint.html#socket/3-websocket-configuration).

See `Phoenix.Token` documentation for examples in
performing token verification on connect.

## id/1

Identifies the socket connection.

Socket IDs are topics that allow you to identify all sockets for a given user:

    def id(socket), do: "users_socket:#{socket.assigns.user_id}"

Would allow you to broadcast a `"disconnect"` event and terminate
all active sockets and channels for a given user:

    MyAppWeb.Endpoint.broadcast("users_socket:" <> user.id, "disconnect", %{})

Returning `nil` makes this socket anonymous.
