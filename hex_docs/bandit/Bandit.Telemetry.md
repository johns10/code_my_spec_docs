# Bandit.Telemetry

The following telemetry spans are emitted by bandit

## `[:bandit, :request, *]`

Represents Bandit handling a specific client HTTP request

This span is started by the following event:

* `[:bandit, :request, :start]`

    Represents the start of the span

    This event contains the following measurements:

    * `monotonic_time`: The time of this event, in `:native` units

    This event contains the following metadata:

    * `telemetry_span_context`: A unique identifier for this span
    * `connection_telemetry_span_context`: The span context of the Thousand Island `:connection`
      span which contains this request
    * `conn`: The `Plug.Conn` representing this connection. Not present in cases where `error`
      is also set and the nature of error is such that Bandit was unable to successfully build
      the conn

      compressed, this is the size of the compressed payload as sent on the wire
    * `resp_uncompressed_body_bytes`: The length of the original, uncompressed body. Only
      included for responses which are compressed

      span which contains this request

      is also set and the nature of error is such that Bandit was unable to successfully build
      the conn
    * `plug`: The Plug which is being used to serve this request. Specified as `{plug_module, plug_opts}`
    * `error`: The error that caused the span to end, if it ended in error

The following events may be emitted within this span:

* `[:bandit, :request, :exception]`

    The request for this span ended unexpectedly

      is also set and the nature of error is such that Bandit was unable to successfully build
      the conn
    * `plug`: The Plug which is being used to serve this request. Specified as `{plug_module, plug_opts}`
    * `kind`: The kind of unexpected condition, typically `:exit`
    * `exception`: The exception which caused this unexpected termination. May be an exception
      or an arbitrary value when the event was an uncaught throw or an exit
    * `stacktrace`: The stacktrace of the location which caused this unexpected termination
