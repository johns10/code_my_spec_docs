the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the authenticated user lacks read access, the API
returns a `404 Not Found` status. If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read
access, the API returns a `410 Gone` status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe
to the [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#issues) webhook.

reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."
