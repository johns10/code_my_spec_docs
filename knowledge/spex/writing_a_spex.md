# Writing a Spex

## File layout

```
test/spex/<story_id>/<criterion_id>_spex.exs
```

One file per acceptance criterion. Module name mirrors the path:

```elixir
defmodule CodeMySpecSpex.Story553.Criterion5081Spex do
```

## Minimal template

```elixir
defmodule CodeMySpecSpex.Story<id>.Criterion<id>Spex do
  @moduledoc """
  Story <n> — <story title>
  Criterion <n> — <what this criterion asserts in plain language>
  """

  use CodeMySpecSpex.Case

  import_givens CodeMySpecSpex.SharedGivens

  setup :register_log_in_setup_account
  setup :setup_active_project

  spex "<engineer/agent> does <action>" do
    scenario "<observable outcome>" do
      given_ :synced_context_component
      given_ :on_configuration_page

      when_ "<single user action>", context do
        # drive the UI or the hook endpoint
        {:ok, context}
      end

      then_ "<observable assertion through the public surface>", context do
        # observe via rendered HTML, HTTP response body, or LiveView element
        :ok
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## What each piece does

- `use CodeMySpecSpex.Case` — wires up ConnTest, LiveViewTest, the
  SexySpex DSL, the DB sandbox, and the `Fixtures` bridge.
- `import_givens CodeMySpecSpex.SharedGivens` — makes `given_ :atom`
  shortcuts available for common setup.
- `setup :register_log_in_setup_account` — registers a user, logs them
  in, activates an account.
- `setup :setup_active_project` — creates a project, attaches a fresh
  in-memory environment to it, registers the env so LiveViews rebuild
  scope against the same memfs. **Always pair it with the auth setup
  above.**

## DSL: `given_`, `when_`, `then_`

Each step returns either `:ok` or `{:ok, context}`. Returning
`{:ok, context}` merges keys into the shared scenario context so
later steps can read them.

### `given_ :name` — shared given

Invokes a step registered in `CodeMySpecSpex.SharedGivens`. Use these
for setup that recurs across specs.

### `given_ "text", context do ... end` — inline given

Establishes state for *this* scenario. Free to reach for fixtures on
the bridge or drive the UI/hooks. Don't assert here — a raise or
pattern-match failure at the point of failure is fine; `then_` is for
outcome assertions.

### `when_ "text", context do ... end`

The one user action under test. Keep it to a single LiveView
interaction or one hook POST. If you need two actions, you probably
need two scenarios.

### `then_ "text", context do ... end`

Observe through the public surface only. **Never read the DB in a
`then_` step** — use the rendered HTML, the HTTP response body, or a
LiveView element query. Multiple `then_` steps are fine and often
read better than one big assertion block.

## The context map

Whatever a step returns as `{:ok, map}` is merged into `context` and
visible to all later steps. Useful keys produced by standard setup:

| Key | Source | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `conn` | Case setup | Authenticated `Plug.Conn` |
| `user` | `:register_and_log_in_user` | The logged-in user |
| `account` | `:setup_active_account` | The active account |
| `project` | `:setup_active_project` | The active project row |
| `scope` | `:setup_active_project` | A `%Scope{}` with `cwd` + `environment` |
| `environment` | `:setup_active_project` | The in-memory env |
| `component` | `:synced_context_component` | Component produced by real sync |
| `config_live` | `:on_configuration_page` | The mounted configuration LiveView |

## Anchor assertions: don't write vacuous refutes

When a `then_` is mostly `refute html =~ "..."`, include at least one
positive assertion for something that *should* still be present. This
proves the graph/page/response actually has content — without the
anchor, an empty string would pass every refute:

```elixir
# Good — anchor proves the page rendered at all.
assert html =~ "implementation_file"
refute html =~ "spec_file"
refute html =~ "spec_valid"
```

See `5081_spex.exs` through `5085_spex.exs` for the pattern.

## Driving the LiveView (engineer actions)

```elixir
{:ok, config_live, _html} =
  live(context.conn, ~p"/projects/#{context.project.name}/configuration")

config_live
|> form("[data-test='configuration-form']", configuration: %{require_specs: false})
|> render_submit()
```

Prefer `data-test` selectors over class or id — they are test-only,
stable, and declare intent. Use `has_element?/2` to assert on rendered
state without scraping HTML.

## Driving the agent surface (hook actions)

```elixir
response =
  Phoenix.ConnTest.build_conn()
  |> Plug.Conn.put_req_header("x-working-dir", context.scope.cwd)
  |> Plug.Conn.put_req_header("content-type", "application/json")
  |> post(~p"/api/hooks/stop", %{})
  |> Phoenix.ConnTest.json_response(200)
```

The `x-working-dir` header is how the hook endpoint resolves the
scope — set it to `context.scope.cwd` (the stub dir planted by
`setup_active_project`).

## Writing files as "the agent"

```elixir
alias CodeMySpec.Environments

:ok = Environments.write_file(context.environment, "lib/example_context.ex", contents)
```

Every file the agent would create must go through `Environments.write_file/3`
against `context.environment`. This is what the memfs interprets, and it's
what the sync pipeline will pick up when the LiveView sync button runs.

## Running specs

```
mix spex                # whole suite
mix spex test/spex/553  # one story
mix spex test/spex/553/5088_spex.exs
```

`mix spex` is aliased in `mix.exs` to `spex --quiet` under `MIX_ENV=test`.
